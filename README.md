Patients are frequently discharged to GP care with conditions with which the GP may not be familiar, and with the need to carry out further investigations and monitor progress.  This hack builds on the existing process of discharge documentation. It provides extra advice for the clinician and patient (via text and hyperlinks). It integrates task management and responsibility for the on-going care as well as providing a comprehensive list of appropriate people to contact.  It is designed to be applicable irrespective of where and how the letter is generated and to can easily be integrated into current live GP systems.  Technology includes: XML, XML databases, javascript rendering, QR codes, and human readable documentation. This was code initiated at the Oxford NHSHackDay 26-27th Jan 2013.
